# AI-disk-scheduling-algorithm
Disk scheduling algorithms are used by operating systems to determine the order in which disk I/O requests are processed, optimizing read/write operations to reduce seek time and improve system performance. Traditional algorithms include FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve), SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First), SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, and C-LOOK.
